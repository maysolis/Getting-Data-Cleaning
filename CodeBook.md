Input Data Description

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
iqr(): Interquartile range
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window. angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

Data Processing / Transformation Steps

Load activity and feature labels data in activity_labels and feature_labels variables.
Load training activity, subject and measurement data in respective training data variables.
Assign feature names to the training data variables.
Remove all measurement columns except mean and standard deviation.
Rename feature names to a more user-readable format. For example, tBodyAcc-mean()-X becomes TimeBodyAccMeanX.
Merge activity names abd subject IDs with the measurement data.
Repeat steps 2 to 6 for test data.
Merge tidy outputs from steps 6 and 7 to create full tidy dataset.
Apply group_by and summarize functions from the dlyr package to calculate average measurement values for each activity and subject.
Export the summarized dataset to a space delimited file called "UCI_HAR_Dataset_Average_Tidy.txt"
Output Data Description

The output from running the "run_analysis.R" script would be a file called "UCI_HAR_Dataset_Average_Tidy.txt". This file has 68 columns and 104 rows including the header. Each row of this file is a vector of averages for each mean and standard deviation measurement calculated at the activity and subject level. Following is a description of the columns.

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

ActivityName: Type of activity
SubjectID: Subject identifier
AvgTimeBodyAccXYZ
AvgTimeGravityAccXYZ
AvgTimeBodyAccJerkXYZ
AvgTimeBodyGyroXYZ
AvgTimeBodyGyroJerkXYZ
AvgTimeBodyAccMag
AvgTimeGravityAccMag
AvgTimeBodyAccJerkMag
AvgTimeBodyGyroMag

AvgFreqBodyAccXYZ
AvgFreqBodyAccJerkXYZ
AvgFreqBodyGyroXYZ
AvgFreqBodyAccMag
AvgFreqBodyBodyAccJerkMag
AvgFreqBodyBodyGyroMag
AvgFreqBodyBodyGyroJerkMag

Mean and Standard Deviation for each of the above variables is calculated as a separate column and averaged to the activity and subject level.
